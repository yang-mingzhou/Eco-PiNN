# [Eco-PiNN: A Physics-informed Neural Network for Eco-toll](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611977653.ch94)

## Abstract:

The eco-toll estimation problem quantifies the expected environmental cost (e.g., energy consumption, exhaust emissions) for a vehicle to travel along a path. This problem
is important for societal applications such as eco-routing, which aims to find paths with the lowest exhaust emission or energy need. The challenges of this problem are threefold: 
(1) the dependence of a vehicleâ€™s eco-toll on its physical parameters; (2) the lack of access to data with eco-toll
information; and (3) the influence of contextual information (i.e. the connections of adjacent segments in the path) on the eco-toll of road segments. 
Prior work on eco-toll estimation has mostly relied on pure data-driven approaches and has high estimation errors given the limited training data. 
To address these limitations, we propose a novel Eco-toll estimation Physics-informed Neural Network framework (Eco-PiNN) using three novel ideas, namely, (1) a physics-informed decoder that integrates the physical laws of the vehicle engine into the network, (2) an attention-based contextual information encoder, and (3) a physics-informed regularization to reduce overfitting. Experiments on real-world
heavy-duty truck data show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of eco-toll estimation compared with state-of-the-art methods

## Datasets
We are not allowed to publish the on-board diagnostics (OBD) dataset described in the paper. 
In future works, we plan to generate some synthetic vehicle travel datasets using vehicle powertrain simulators 
(e.g., [FastSim](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/fastsim.html#:~:text=The%20Future%20Automotive%20Systems%20Technology,%2C%20cost%2C%20and%20battery%20life.)).
We will publish the code for generating the synthetic datasets and the corresponding datasets in the future.
